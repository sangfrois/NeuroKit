def entropy_fuzzy(signal, delay=1, dimension=2, r="default", n=1, composite=False, **kwargs):
    """Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn)

    Python implementations of the fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) of a signal.

    This function can be called either via ``entropy_fuzzy()`` or ``complexity_fuzzyen()``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : list, array or Series
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    delay : int
        Time delay (often denoted 'Tau', sometimes referred to as 'lag'). In practice, it is common to have a fixed time lag (corresponding for instance to the sampling rate; Gautama, 2003), or to find a suitable value using some algorithmic heuristics (see ``delay_optimal()``).
    dimension : int
        Embedding dimension (often denoted 'm' or 'd', sometimes referred to as 'order'). Typically 2 or 3. It corresponds to the number of compared runs of lagged data. If 2, the embedding returns an array with two columns corresponding to the original signal and its delayed (by Tau) version.
    r : float
        Tolerance (i.e., filtering level - max absolute difference between segments). If 'default', will be set to 0.2 times the standard deviation of the signal (for dimension = 2).
    n : float
        Step width of fuzzy exponential function. Larger `n` makes the function
        more rectangular. Usually in the range 1-5 (default is 1).

    Returns
    ----------
    float
        The fuzzy entropy as float value.

    >>>
