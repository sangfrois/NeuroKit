def signal_findpeaks(signal, height_min=None, height_max=None, relative_height_min=None, relative_height_max=None, relative_mean=True, relative_median=False, relative_max=False):
    """Find peaks in a signal.

    Locate peaks (local maxima) in a signal and their related characteristics, such as height (prominence), width and distance with other peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : list, array or Series
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.
    height_min, distance_max : float
        The minimum or maximum height (i.e., amplitude in terms of absolute values). For example, `height_min=20` will remove all peaks which height is smaller or equal to 20 (in the provided signal's values).
    relative_height_min, relative_height_max : float
        The minimum or maximum height (i.e., amplitude) relative to the sample (see below).
    relative_mean, relative_median, relative_max : bool
        If a relative threshold is specified, how should it be computed (i.e., relative to what?). `relative_mean=True` will use Z-scores. For example, `relative_height_min=-2.96` will remove all peaks which height lies below 2.96 standard deviations from the mean of the heights. Relative to median uses a more robust form of standardization (see `standardize`), and relative to max will consider the maximum height as the reference.

    Returns
    ----------
    dict
        Returns a dict itself containing 5 arrays:
            - 'Peaks' contains the peaks indices (as relative to the given signal). For instance, the value 3 means that the third data point of the signal is a peak.
            - 'Distance' contains, for each peak, the closest distance with another peak. Note that these values will be recomputed after filtering to match the selected peaks.
            - 'Height' contains the prominence of each peak. See `scipy.signal.peak_prominences()`.
            - 'Width' contains the width of each peak. See `scipy.signal.peak_widths()`.
            - 'Onset' contains the onset, start (or left trough), of each peak.
            - 'Offset' contains the offset, end (or right trough), of each peak.

    Examples
    ---------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>> import scipy.misc
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=5)
    >>> info = nk.signal_findpeaks(signal)
    >>> nk.events_plot([info["Onsets"], info["Peaks"]], signal)
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_distord(signal)
    >>> info = nk.signal_findpeaks(signal, height_min=1, width_min=2)
    >>> nk.events_plot(info["Peaks"], signal)
    >>>
    >>> # Filter peaks
    >>> ecg = scipy.misc.electrocardiogram()
    >>> signal = ecg[0:1000]
    >>> info1 = nk.signal_findpeaks(signal, relative_height_min=0)
    >>> info2 = nk.signal_findpeaks(signal, relative_height_min=1)
    >>> nk.events_plot([info1["Peaks"], info2["Peaks"]], signal)
