    """Compute respiration (RSP) rate.

    Compute respiration rate with the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which the inhalation peaks occur. If a dict or a
        DataFrame is passed, it is assumed that these containers were obtained
        with `rsp_peaks()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains the peaks (in Hz,
        i.e., samples/second). Defaults to 1000Hz.
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned respiration rate has the same number of
        elements as `peaks`. If set to an integer, the returned rate will be
        interpolated between `peaks` over `desired_length` samples. Has no
        effect if a DataFrame is passed in as the `peaks` argument.
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of 'khodadad2018'
        (default) or 'biosppy'.
    interpolation_method : str
        Method used to interpolate the rate between peaks. See `signal_interpolate()`.

    Returns
    -------
    array
        A vector containing the respiration rate.
