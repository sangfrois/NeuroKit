    "# The Structure of Indices of Heart Rate Variability\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "The recording of cardiovascular activity with the help of electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals provides a cost-efficient and reliable window into the autonomic nervous system (ANS). These biosignals provide complex patterns of variability present in any biological systems, i.e. Heart-Rate Variability (HRV). These patterns exhibit the underlying organization of ANS and can be described as mathematical chaos (Shaffer et al. 2015). The aim of this study is to explore the factorial structure of the patterns of HRV.\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "HRV can be defined as the oscillation of the interval between consecutive heartbeats, or inter-beat intervals (IBIs), as regulated by the nervous system. The heart is dually innervated by the two constituents of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) namely, the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) nervous system. The ANS dynamically regulates an individual’s heart rate in response to internal, and external events, e.g.  an increase in blood pressure related or not to a stressful event. While the PNS exert more dynamic control over heart rate, the SNS is reported to have more influence on myocardial contractility, meaning they have distinct modes of innervation (Berntson, Quigley, Norman, & Lozano, 2017, p. 189). The PNS changes HR in terms of miliseconds, while the SNS acts on HR in terms of seconds. In this sense, one can suppose that the factorial structure of HRV's indices is informative of autonomic organization.\n",
    "### Research problem\n",
    "Although HRV is conceptually simple, the relations between its multiple indices still remain complex to interpret. We use the term indices to describe each variable derived from the IBIs distribution and the  distribution of differences between successive IBIs. The factorial structure of these variables is prone to be altered according to the experimental condition, but also the context, body position, metabolism etc. Significant work has been done to provide a clear methodological framework in response to these issues. Researchers have provided guidelines to validate and share results transparently (Quintana &. Heathers, 2014; Quintana et al. 2016), on top of classic standards (Task Force, 1996), and clear systematic definition of HRV variables (Shaffer et al. 2015). However, Laborde, Mosley & Thayer (2017) argued that some confusion still is present as to the relationship between variables computed from IBIs and their meaning in a given experimental context, i.e. what’s the level of cardiac vagal tone. We aim to respond to this issue by discussing the statistical relationships of these variables independently of experimental context. A principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of our data and isolate factors that could be related to ANS' components contribution. \n",
    "## Method\n",
    "In light of the recommendations published in the last decade, this study explores the statistical relationships between all indices of HRV using open-access databases of annotated ECG signals and NeuroKit data preparation pipeline. In order to allow proper isolation of non-redundant related indices of HRV, PCA will be used as a dimensionality reduction technique to explore their relationships."
